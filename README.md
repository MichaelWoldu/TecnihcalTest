# Tecnihcal Test
## How it Works
It imports the data from the csv file in the folder 'Data' into an array. Before we start calculating the percentage value of each interaction, 
we clean up the array removing columns we do not need. Using a loop, we count and calculate the percentage of interactions for each sector. 
As I am using CanvasJs to graphically represent the data, we need to store these percentages in an array. Then using the code snippit from CanvasJs, 
the data is represented in a pie chart.

## Language Used
* PHP 7.3
* HTML5
* JavaScript

## External Scripts
* CanvasJs

## Further Imporvment
In further interactions, the objective should be to make the page more interactive. This would mean allowing the user to input their csv file 
from the UI. There should also be a download option so that users can get a table with the percentage results.

## How to run
As the webpage is static and very simple, the easiest way to run this would be to use a WAMP server.
